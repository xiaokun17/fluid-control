# Target-driven Fluid control

We proposed a novel target-driven fluid simulation method based on the weighted
control model derived from the spatial geometric features of the target shape. First,
the spatial geometric characteristics of the target model are taken into account to
set the color field weights of control particles. This enabled the full expression of
geometric characteristics of the target model, and improve the shape accuracy of
controlled fluid. Then, the fluid is controlled to form the target shape under driving
constraints, wherein we proposed a new adaptive constraint mechanism that enables
efficient target shape generation. Finally, a new density constraint between the control
particles and the controlled fluid particles is proposed to ensure the incompressibility
of fluid during control. Compared to the state-of-the-art target-driven fluid control
methods, our method achieves higher precision fluid control with higher efficiency
